# Chat2Chat Alpha 1.0
This is one of my first c++ projects which is also my introduction to working with networking using a low-level coding language, my goal for this project is to turn it into a chat room that utilizes encryption
that others will be able to use to discretely send chats between each other.

Make sure you build both the server code and client code in `Release | x64` using visual studios
